# Experiments Directory

This directory will contain all experiment outputs:

- `logs/` - Training logs
- `checkpoints/` - Model checkpoints
- `xai_outputs/` - Attribution visualizations
- `concept_results/` - TCAV analysis results
- `manifold_plots/` - UMAP/PCA visualizations
- `llm_explanations/` - Generated text explanations

Each training run creates a timestamped subdirectory with the experiment name.
